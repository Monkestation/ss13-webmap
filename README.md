# Monkestation WebMap

This is the repo of the Monkestation Webmap project, based off of the [static version](https://github.com/AffectedArc07/SS13WebMap/tree/archived) of [AffectArc07's SS13WebMap](https://github.com/AffectedArc07/SS13WebMap)

While the page layout remains roughly the same, this version uses Liquid templating, and Fastify, to serve the map files, as well as using a new map generation script.

This project still relys on DMM-Tools from [SpacemanDMM](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/) being present in the root of the project, or in your `PATH`.
